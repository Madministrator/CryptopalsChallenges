# CryptopalsChallenges
My attempt at solving the Cryptopals crypto challenges.

If you want to see the challenges that sparked this repository, visit the [cryptopals crypto challenges website](https://cryptopals.com/). 

I am solving these challenges for two primary reasons. First: I want to explore cryptography a little more than I did during college. I couldn't fit the cryptography course I wanted to take into my schedule before graduation, so this is my attempt at self-guided learning. Second: this seems like a fun way for me to keep certain languages fresh in my brain that I don't normally use in my career. So I will be using languages that simply aren't normally in my repetoire, starting with Python.

It is my goal that once I have cracked some of these challenges in Python, I will use the solutions I have already built and translate them into other languages that I use only rarely. Thus making a library of crypto breaking tools in a variety of languages. 

As a stretch goal, I may take one or two of the command line friendlier languages and use them to build a command line tool that puts all of the work together into one crypto breaking tool.
